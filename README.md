# Prototype Playground

Many times I tested arrays methods using node or browser console. To keep the things easier I decied to create a playground to have fun with Javascript prototype methods.

**You can check it out in: [playground.gsales.io](https://playground.gsales.io)**

For this first version the Prototype Playground has only my most common used array methods, for next interations will have more array methods and other types of prototypes.

Feel free to contribute!
